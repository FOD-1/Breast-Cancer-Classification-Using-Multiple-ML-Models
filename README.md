# Breast Cancer Classification Project
This repository contains code for a breast cancer classification project using both MATLAB and Python. The goal of this project is to determine whether a given input of breast cancer is either Benign or Malignant using various Machine Learning classifiers. The dataset used for this project is a public breast cancer dataset from Kaggle.

# MATLAB
The MATLAB file Breast_Cancer_Detection.m implements the classifiers using the breast cancer dataset from Kaggle. It uses the same classifiers as the Python code.
To run the MATLAB code, make sure you have MATLAB installed, and then open and run the script Breast_Cancer_Detection.m.
To run the MATLAB code, you will need the following:
MATLAB software (R2018b or later)
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

# Dataset
The dataset can be found in the "breast-cancer.csv" file. It contains features extracted from breast mass images and corresponding labels indicating whether the tumor is Benign or Malignant.

# Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
scikit-learn
pandas
matplotlib

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Navigate to the root folder of the project.
Run the Breast Cancer Detection Using Multiple ML Models.ipynb Jupyter notebook to explore and preprocess the data, train different classifiers, and evaluate their performance.

# Models
The project utilizes the following classifiers:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Naive Bayes
Neural Networks 

# Evaluation
The evaluation metrics used to compare the performance of each model are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

# Conclusion
After comparing the results of each model, the best performing classifier will be identified. Feel free to explore the code and dataset to gain insights into breast cancer classification using machine learning.
